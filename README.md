# MDADM Linear Device
This project implements the Linear Device functionality of the Multiple Disks and Drives Administration (MDADM) that allows a user to treat a number of separate drives in the Just a Bunch of Disks (JBOD) format as a single drive. The code written completes all of the underlying functionality to manage data reading and writing across the disks.
